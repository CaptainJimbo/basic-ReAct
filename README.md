# basic ReAct
A simple implementation of the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern for AI agents.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the ReAct framework, which combines reasoning and acting in language models to solve complex tasks through iterative thought processes and tool usage.

## Features

- Basic ReAct agent implementation
- Tool integration capabilities
- Step-by-step reasoning process
- Action execution framework

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the ReAct agent
python basic_react.py
```

## How it Works

The ReAct pattern follows this cycle:
1. **Thought** - Reason about the current situation
2. **Action** - Execute a tool or function
3. **Observation** - Process the results
4. **Repeat** - Continue until task completion

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`
